# RISCV 32bit 3-level pipeline CPU
This codebase is the official implementation of our **32-bit three-level pipeline CPU**. We verify the validity through synthesis and simulation using EDA software, and the validation instruction text document is shown above.
## Quick Start
### Installation
- Vivado
- modelsim
### Note
1. Different module code is included in `RISC-V-32-pipeline-CPU-main/rtl`.
2. Code of common modules is included in `RISC-V-32-pipeline-CPU-main/utils`
3. `RISC-V-32-pipeline-CPU-main/tb` contains testbench and top level of the CPU. 
4.  The testing instruction lines are included in `RISC-V-32-pipeline-CPU-main/tb/inst_txt`
